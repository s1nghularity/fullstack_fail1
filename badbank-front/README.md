# Bad Bank App
## _Front End Portfolio Project_

:bowtie:https://vikramsinghbadbank.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

Welcome to my front-end project for the MERN stack bootcamp with MITxPro.

- Create an account
- Withdraw and deposit money from a pre-determined account
- ✨Go to the All Data page to see tracked transactions ✨

## Lessons Learned

- Set up a router for a single-page application
- Created a sign-up form which uses a seperate form component
- Used context and state to 'save' user creation, withdrawals, and deposits 

The next steps for this app include login functionality, the ability to manipulate different user accounts and most importantly refreshing the page will not reset user data.
